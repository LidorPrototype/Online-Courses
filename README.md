# Online-Courses
### Hello,

This repository contains 2 files only: this "README" file you're currently reading, and another text file that contains the list of the online courses that I completed.

Each course I completed will be provided by a link (only if still available) and the website name. If the link doesn't work, try googling the name of the course or searching it in the courses website. If for any other reason you cannot reach the course's website - please file me an official issue and I will try to find it another way or will inform you if the course is indeed no longer available. 

If you have any more questions regarding the courses, or would like a personal / professional opinion on them - feel free to submit a request about it via the email address that appears on my profile and I will gladly answer.


_Courses website include: [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com/), [Databricks](https://databricks.com/learn/training/home), [edX](https://www.edx.org/)_
