# Online-Courses
### Hello,

this repository is a 2 files only, this README file you're currently reading, and another text file which is the list of 
the online courses I did and finished.

each course I did will be provided with a link to the course (only if the course is still available), and website name.
if a course link doesn't work for you, try googling the name of the course or searching it in the course website, if
still you canwt find the course or the website says it's deleted, you are more then welcome to file an official issue in 
here, I will look at that issue and either send you a link to the course or update that the course is not longer available.

if you have any more questions regarding the courses, or you would like a personal / proffesional opinion on it, feel 
free to submit an issue about it and I will answer.
